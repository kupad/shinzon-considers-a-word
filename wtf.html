        <p>Praetor Shinzon: There's a word I want you to consider: Allegiance. It's something I demand from those who serve me.</p>
        <p>Commander Donatra: Do I serve you?</p>
        <p>Praetor Shinzon: Yes. And I think, faithfully. Commander Suran on the other hand... gives me pause.</p>
        <p>Commander Donatra: Here's another word, Praetor: Trust. Do you trust me? How far does that trust extend? How... deep... does it go? What must a commander do to prove herself faithful to you? What must a woman do?</p>
        <p>[she stretches her hand out to touch Shinzon's face, but he snatches it away at the last moment]</p>
        <p>Praetor Shinzon: You... are not a woman. You are a Romulan.</p>
